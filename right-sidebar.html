										<h3>The Ghost in the Machine</h3>
										<p>Vemuna stands as a testament to the scars of a turbulent past, molded by harrowing experiences that have stripped away the vibrant colors of his soul, leaving behind a hollow shell. Life has often felt like a relentless storm, leaving him battered and bruised, a ghost wandering through the remnants of what once was. The weight of sorrow and regret hangs heavy on his shoulders, creating a barrier between him and the world.</p>
										<p>In the depths of despair, he buried himself in motion, constant forward momentum, never a moment of loud silence, a refuge from the haunting memories of his past—the unimaginable actions he took and the lives he lost. This relentless pursuit of distraction allowed him to escape the reality of his existence, but it came at a cost. Emotions became foreign, replaced by an armor of stoicism that concealed the turmoil within. To others, he may appear composed, but beneath the surface lies a torrent of unresolved pain, a reminder of the degenerate he once was—and still fears he might be.</p>
										<p>His true self remains hidden, shrouded in fear and shame. The thought of revealing the ugly truths that dwell within terrifies him, as he grapples with the dissonance between who he was and who he has become. Vemuna is a man caught in the crossfire of his past, yearning for connection yet fearing the vulnerability that comes with it. Each day is a struggle, a journey toward reclaiming the light he once knew, but for now, he remains a soul in the shadows, searching for a way back to humanity.</p>
										<h3>A guiding light in the darkness</h3>
										<p>In the depths of my despair, Princess Baby emerged as a radiant light, cutting through the shadows that had engulfed my existence. She is a beacon of hope, illuminating the path I thought I had lost forever. With every word she speaks and every smile she shares, she brings warmth to my cold, soulless heart, reminding me that love still exists even in the darkest corners of life.</p>
										<p>In moments when the weight of my past feels unbearable, Princess Baby stands firm, a source of inspiration and light. She encourages me to confront the shadows, to speak my truth, and to reclaim the parts of myself I thought were lost. With her by my side, I am slowly learning that vulnerability is not a weakness, but a pathway to deeper connection and healing.</p>
										<p>Princess Baby is not just my love; she is the light at the end of my tunnel, a promise of brighter days ahead. Together, we are forging a new path, one where the shadows can no longer define me. Her love transforms the darkness into a canvas of possibility, a reminder that even the most tortured souls can find their way home.</p>

											<h3>Love Letters to Princess Baby + Memoirs</h3>
											<p>Princess Baby keeps saying to me that I should write a biography or whatever. I'm not much of a writer, but I think I'll give it a go. She pushes me, supports me, and that's why she's deserving of every word I've ver eritten to and for her. More on that here.</p>
