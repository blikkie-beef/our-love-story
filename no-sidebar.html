								<h3>"Pinky how dare you not pick up. Now I'm sad" - Pookie, September 2024</h3>
								<p>Jason, the Nigerian Prince, the Big Bastard, the Terrorist, our sweetheart is turning 4, and each day is a precious gift that fills our hearts with immeasurable joy. Despite the health battles his tiny body has faced, he radiates a sweet, aloof innocence that captures our hearts and reminds us of the beauty of life. His laughter echoes like music, a sound that brings warmth and light to even the darkest days. Every smile he shares and every moment he finds joy in Humpty Dumpty, or any egg-shaped treasure for that matter, is just about the cutest thing you'll ever see.</p>
								<p>He is our greatest reason to wake up each morning, inspiring us to create a life filled with love, laughter, and happiness. His mother’s love for him knows no bounds, enveloping him in a warmth that will forever be his safe haven. Faith? Your love for Jason is one that motivates me so much. I see you.</p>
								<p>She'd give anything for Jason to have a happy, fulfilled life, a love so profound that it transcends all boundaries. Her devotion to him knows no limits; she would willingly sacrifice her last cent to ensure his joy, especially on his special days. Each birthday is a celebration of his light, and she pours her heart into making it unforgettable for him. She dreams of a world where he is surrounded by laughter and happiness, where every wish he makes comes true. For her, nothing is more important than seeing that radiant smile on his face, knowing that her sacrifices, however small or great, contribute to his happiness. In her eyes, his joy is the ultimate reward, and she tirelessly works to create memories that will fill his heart with warmth and delight for years to come. Her love is a powerful force, driving her to ensure that he grows up in a world brimming with love, support, and endless possibilities.</p>

								<h3>Bemuna's Promise</h3>
								<p>Jason, as your father, I promise to be your protector, your guide, and your unwavering support throughout your life. I will shield you from harm and be the steady hand you can always hold, no matter the challenges that may come. I will strive to be emotionally present for you, not just in the big moments, but in the quiet, everyday times, so that you always feel seen, heard, and understood.</p>
								<p>I promise to nurture your growth and to teach you the values that will help you navigate this world with strength and kindness. I will instill in you the importance of accountability, of standing by your words and actions, and of always doing what is right, even when it is hard.</p>
								<p>Above all, I promise to give you the love and care that I never had. You are my greatest joy, the reason I wake up every morning, and the driving force behind everything I do. Together with your mother, we will build a life for you that is filled with happiness, laughter, and endless possibilities. You will always know love, you will always know you are cherished, and you will always know that I will move mountains to give you the life you deserve.</p>
								<p>Faith? Thank you for gifting me this responsibility. To be a father to Jason, I'm sure, is something you had to think long and hard about. Thank you, that you look at me, and see me as a father for your son. I promise you, I do not tkae this lightly, and that from this moment on, I will dedicate my life to him.</p>
								<p>This is my solemn promise to you, my son—today and forever.</p>
