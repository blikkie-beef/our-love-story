								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>Faith is a woman of unparalleled depth—her soul, though tortured by life’s many trials, shines with an inner strength that defies the darkness she's faced. She carries the weight of sorrow and pain, bearing scars that tell stories of resilience and survival. Through it all, she remains gentle, her heart tender, even after the world has tried to harden it.</p>
									<p>Behind her soft smile lies the strength of someone who has endured more than most will ever know. Yet, despite her past, she continues to love fiercely, to give selflessly, and to live with a grace that only those who have been tested by fire can possess.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>She is both fragile and unbreakable—a paradox that makes her so uniquely beautiful.</p>
									<p>Her tortured soul does not define her but fuels her ability to find joy in even the smallest moments. She is a reminder that even the most hurtful experiences cannot dim the light within someone who refuses to give up. To me, Princess Baby is more than just the love of my life—she is a symbol of hope, of what it means to rise from the ashes stronger than before.</p>

							<h2>And just who is he?</h2>
							<p>He is the lucky one. The one who got away.</p>
						</header>
						<p>For as long as he can remember, he has walked this world alone, racked with sorrow, burdened by secrets too dark to speak. He grew up in isolation, hiding the unimaginable things he had done, living a life that no one could truly know or understand—until he met her, his Princess Baby.</p>
						<p>She was the first to see beyond the mask he wore. With her gentle heart, she pulled the truth from him, the truth he had buried beneath layers of pain, shame, and lies. She is the only person who fully knows him—the darkness he carries, the nightmares that haunt him, the memories of watching his best friend die, of losing so many others along the way. She knows the degenerate he was and loves me anyway. He's a lucky man.</p>

							<p>"Someone like you", is exactly what's been missing from my life for the entirety of it." - Princess Baby, 07 June 2024</p>
						</header>
						<p>She is more than his love—she is his salvation. Together, they are two broken souls who have found solace in one another. She holds him when the darkness closes in, and he does the same for her. In her arms, he has found peace. In her heart, He has found a reason to keep fighting, to keep living. And though their pasts are filled with pain, their future holds the unwavering hope that together, they can heal.</p>
